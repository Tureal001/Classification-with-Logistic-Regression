I worked on the iris dataset using Logistic Regression to predict the species of flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements. I started by preprocessing the data and splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, I trained the Logistic Regression model and evaluated it using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and ROC curves. These metrics helped me understand how well the model classified each flower species. Finally, I compared Logistic Regression with other classifiers like Random Forest and SVM to see if more complex models could give better results. This process showed me how Logistic Regression can be a strong baseline model for classification tasks.
